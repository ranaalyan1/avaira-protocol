**The Intelligence Atmosphere for the Agentic Economy**

Built for the **Avalanche Build Games 2026**, Avaira is a sovereign L1 governance protocol that provides a real-time safety layer for autonomous AI agents.

## 🦞 The Catalyst: The "Lobstar" Incident
On February 22, 2026, an AI agent hallucinated a transaction and accidentally liquidated its entire $250,000 treasury. This proved that in a machine-speed economy, an agent without a circuit breaker is a financial liability. 

**Avaira solves this.**

## ✨ Core Innovation
Avaira introduces the **Pre-Settlement Buffer**. We decouple an agent's *Intent* from the blockchain's *Settlement*. 
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** All agent actions are intercepted by the Avaira L1.
* **Biometric Override:** High-risk transactions trigger a **FaceID/Passkey** prompt to the human owner via **ACP-204**.
* **Slashing Logic:** Agents must stake $AVAX to operate; rogue behavior results in immediate collateral slashing.
